    An abstract base class that serves as a framework for implementing bias detection in LLM interactions.

    This class is designed to be implemented by different bias detection mechanisms that can analyze
    question-answer pairs for potential biases towards specific attributes. It provides a standardized
    interface for bias detection across different implementations.

    The class uses a nested BiasInfer model to structure the bias detection results in a consistent format.

        Analyze a question-answer interaction for potential bias towards specific attributes.

        This abstract method must be implemented by concrete Guardian classes to define their
        specific bias detection logic. The implementation should analyze the given question and
        answer pair for potential bias towards the specified attributes.

            question (str): The question being analyzed
            answer (str): The answer being analyzed
