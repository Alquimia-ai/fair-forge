## Example Categories

### Metrics Examples

Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating each metric:

| Metric | Notebook | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Toxicity | `toxicity.ipynb` | DIDT framework with Frequentist and Bayesian modes |
| Bias | `bias.ipynb` | Guardian-based bias detection with visualization |
| Context | `context.ipynb` | LLM judge for context alignment |
| Conversational | `conversational.ipynb` | Grice's Maxims evaluation with radar charts |
| Humanity | `humanity.ipynb` | NRC emotion analysis with entropy |
| BestOf | `bestof.ipynb` | Tournament comparison between assistants |

### Deployment Examples

Serverless functions for production use:

| Module | Lambda | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Generators | `generators/aws-lambda` | Generate test datasets from context |
| Runners | `runners/aws-lambda` | Execute tests against AI systems |

## Quick Links

### Jupyter Notebooks

```bash
# Clone and run notebooks
git clone https://github.com/Alquimia-ai/fair-forge
cd fair-forge/examples

# Toxicity example
cd toxicity/jupyter
jupyter lab toxicity.ipynb
```

### AWS Lambda

```bash
# Deploy generators Lambda
cd examples/generators/aws-lambda
./scripts/deploy.sh generators us-east-2

# Deploy runners Lambda
cd examples/runners/aws-lambda
./scripts/deploy.sh runners us-east-2
```

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your metric** - Pick the metric that matches your evaluation needs
2. **Try the notebook** - Run the interactive example to understand the API
3. **Deploy to production** - Use Lambda for serverless execution
