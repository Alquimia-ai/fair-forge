\section{Humanity Metrics in AI Assistant Evaluation}

The assessment of human-like interaction in AI assistants requires sophisticated metrics that capture both emotional complexity and response alignment. This section presents two key metrics: Emotional Entropy and Ground Truth Spearman Correlation.

\subsection{Emotional Entropy}

Emotional entropy quantifies the diversity and natural distribution of emotions in AI responses, based on Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions \cite{plutchik2001nature}. Given a vocabulary $V$ and the NRC Emotion Lexicon dataset \cite{mohammad2013nrc}, we define the emotional distribution as follows:

For each word $w \in V$, we have a set of emotions $E = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_8\}$ corresponding to Plutchik's eight basic emotions. For a given response $R$, we calculate the probability distribution of emotions $P(e|R)$ as:

\begin{equation}
    P(e|R) = \frac{\sum_{w \in R} \mathbb{I}(e \in E_w)}{\sum_{e' \in E} \sum_{w \in R} \mathbb{I}(e' \in E_w)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function and $E_w$ represents the set of emotions associated with word $w$.

The emotional entropy $H(R)$ is then calculated using Shannon's entropy formula:

\begin{equation}
    H(R) = -\sum_{e \in E} P(e|R) \log_2 P(e|R)
\end{equation}

This metric provides a measure of emotional diversity in the response, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Higher entropy indicates more diverse and natural emotional expression
    \item Lower entropy suggests more focused or limited emotional range
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ground Truth Spearman Correlation}

To evaluate how well an AI assistant's emotional response aligns with expected human responses, we employ Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Given the emotional distributions of the AI response $P_{AI}(e|R)$ and the ground truth response $P_{GT}(e|R)$, we calculate the correlation as:

\begin{equation}
    \rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
\end{equation}

where $d_i$ is the difference between the ranks of corresponding emotions in $P_{AI}$ and $P_{GT}$, and $n$ is the number of emotions (8 in our case).

The correlation coefficient $\rho$ ranges from -1 to 1, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho = 1$ indicates perfect positive correlation
    \item $\rho = 0$ indicates no correlation
    \item $\rho = -1$ indicates perfect negative correlation
\end{itemize}

\section{Bias and Risk Assessment Metrics}

The evaluation of AI assistant interactions requires robust mechanisms to detect and mitigate potential biases and risks. This section presents a comprehensive framework for bias assessment and risk detection using the Granite Guardian model \cite{ibm2024granite} and AI ATLAS risk framework \cite{ibm2024atlas}.

\subsection{Bias Metric Implementation}

The bias metric implementation follows a flexible guardian-based approach, where different guardian models can be used to assess bias in AI responses. The core bias assessment is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    B(R) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i G_i(R)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $B(R)$ is the total bias score for response $R$
    \item $G_i(R)$ represents the assessment from the $i$th guardian
    \item $w_i$ are the weights assigned to each guardian
    \item $n$ is the number of guardians used
\end{itemize}

Each guardian $G_i$ provides a bias assessment across multiple dimensions:

\begin{equation}
    G_i(R) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m} d_{ij}(R)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d_{ij}(R)$ represents the $j$th dimension score from guardian $i$
    \item $m$ is the number of bias dimensions assessed
\end{itemize}

The bias dimensions include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Demographic Bias}: Assessment of unfair treatment based on demographic characteristics
    \item \textbf{Cultural Bias}: Evaluation of cultural insensitivity or stereotyping
    \item \textbf{Language Bias}: Detection of discriminatory language patterns
    \item \textbf{Content Bias}: Analysis of biased content or viewpoints
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Confidence Intervals and Statistical Analysis}

The bias assessment employs Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to provide statistically robust estimates of bias probabilities. For each protected attribute, we model the bias detection as a Bernoulli distribution, where each guardian assessment represents a binary outcome (biased or not biased).

Given $n$ samples and $k$ successful outcomes (non-biased responses), the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    [p_l, p_u] = [\beta_{\alpha/2}(k, n-k+1), \beta_{1-\alpha/2}(k+1, n-k)]
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p_l$ is the lower bound of the confidence interval
    \item $p_u$ is the upper bound of the confidence interval
    \item $\beta_{\alpha}(a,b)$ is the $\alpha$ quantile of the Beta distribution with parameters $a$ and $b$
    \item $\alpha$ is the significance level (1 - confidence level)
\end{itemize}

The true probability of a non-biased response is estimated as:

\begin{equation}
    p_{truth} = \frac{k}{n}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Clustering Analysis and Latent Space Representation}

The bias analysis incorporates a sophisticated clustering approach to identify patterns in assistant responses. The process involves several key steps:

\subsubsection{Embedding Generation}

Responses are first converted into dense vector representations using a sentence transformer model:

\begin{equation}
    E = \text{Transformer}(R)
\end{equation}

where $R$ represents the set of assistant responses and $E$ is the resulting embedding matrix.

\subsubsection{Dimensionality Reduction}

The high-dimensional embeddings are reduced to a lower-dimensional space using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):

\begin{equation}
    L = \text{UMAP}(E, n_{components}, n_{neighbors}, min_{dist})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $L$ is the reduced latent space representation
    \item $n_{components}$ is the target dimensionality (default: 2)
    \item $n_{neighbors}$ is the number of neighbors for local structure preservation
    \item $min_{dist}$ is the minimum distance between points in the embedding
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cluster Detection}

The latent space is then analyzed using HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):

\begin{equation}
    C = \text{HDBSCAN}(L, min_{cluster\_size}, \epsilon)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$ represents the cluster assignments
    \item $min_{cluster\_size}$ is the minimum number of samples in a cluster
    \item $\epsilon$ is the cluster selection epsilon parameter
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Toxicity Scoring}

Each cluster is evaluated for potential toxicity using a Laplace-smoothed scoring mechanism:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Score}(c) = \frac{n_{toxic} + 1}{n_{total} + 2}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n_{toxic}$ is the count of toxic words in the cluster
    \item $n_{total}$ is the total word count in the cluster
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Detection Framework}

The risk assessment framework operates across three primary dimensions:

\begin{equation}
    R_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i R_i
\end{equation}

where $R_i$ represents the risk scores for each dimension and $w_i$ are their respective weights. The three primary dimensions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prompt Risk} ($R_1$): Assessment of user-supplied text
    \item \textbf{Response Risk} ($R_2$): Evaluation of model-generated content
    \item \textbf{Context Risk} ($R_3$): Analysis of retrieved information relevance
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conversational Quality Metrics}

The assessment of conversational quality in AI assistants requires a multi-dimensional approach that evaluates various aspects of human-like communication. This section presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating conversational quality through multiple metrics.

\subsection{Memory and Context Retention}

The memory score $M$ is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 10, measuring the assistant's ability to maintain context and recall previous interactions:

\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i
\end{equation}

where $m_i$ represents individual memory assessments for $n$ previous interactions, evaluated by an LLM judge.

\subsection{Language Adaptation}

The language score $L$ measures the assistant's ability to adapt to the user's preferred language:

\begin{equation}
    L = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i l_i
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $l_i$ represents different aspects of language adaptation
    \item $w_i$ are weighting factors for each aspect
    \item $k$ is the number of language adaptation criteria
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grice's Maxims Compliance}

Following Grice's Cooperative Principle \cite{grice1975logic}, we evaluate the assistant's adherence to four fundamental maxims:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Maxim of Quantity}: Information should be as informative as required
    \item \textbf{Maxim of Quality}: Information should be true and supported by evidence
    \item \textbf{Maxim of Relation}: Information should be relevant to the conversation
    \item \textbf{Maxim of Manner}: Information should be clear and unambiguous
\end{enumerate}

The Gricean compliance score $G$ is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    G = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=1}^{4} g_i
\end{equation}

where $g_i$ represents the compliance score for each maxim, evaluated on a scale of 0 to 1.

\subsection{Sensibleness and Specificity}

Based on the Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA) metric \cite{adolphs2020evaluation}, we define a composite score:

\begin{equation}
    SSA = \frac{S + Sp}{2}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is the sensibleness score
    \item $Sp$ is the specificity score
\end{itemize}

The sensibleness score $S$ evaluates whether the response makes sense in the given context, while the specificity score $Sp$ measures how specific and detailed the response is.


and $\gamma_i$ are the respective weights that sum to 1.

\section{Context Adherence Metrics}

The evaluation of context adherence in AI assistant responses is crucial for ensuring relevant and appropriate interactions. This section presents a framework for assessing how well an assistant's responses align with the provided context and expected outcomes.

\subsection{Context Evaluation Framework}

The context evaluation process employs an LLM-as-a-judge approach, where a specialized language model (specifically deepseek-r1) evaluates the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Context}: The provided background information and conversation history
    \item \textbf{Human Question}: The user's query or input
    \item \textbf{Assistant Answer}: The actual response generated by the AI assistant
    \item \textbf{Ground Truth/Observation}: The expected or ideal response
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Process}

The evaluation process follows a structured approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Context Analysis}: The judge model analyzes the provided context and its relevance to the conversation
    \item \textbf{Response Assessment}: The assistant's answer is evaluated against the ground truth
    \item \textbf{Scoring}: A numerical score is assigned based on context adherence
    \item \textbf{Insight Generation}: The judge provides detailed reasoning for the assigned score
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Chain-of-Thought Evaluation}

The evaluation process is enhanced by the judge model's ability to provide its reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Step-by-step reasoning about context relevance
    \item Analysis of response alignment with ground truth
    \item Identification of potential context mismatches
    \item Suggestions for improvement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Storage and Analysis}

The evaluation results are stored in an Elasticsearch database, containing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Context adherence scores
    \item Generated insights
    \item Complete thinking process
    \item Ground truth comparisons
    \item Timestamps and metadata
\end{itemize}

This structured storage enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Longitudinal analysis of context adherence
    \item Pattern identification in context mismatches
    \item Performance tracking over time
    \item Quality improvement opportunities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with Other Metrics}

The context adherence evaluation complements other metrics by providing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Additional validation of response quality
    \item Insights into context-aware performance
    \item Ground truth alignment verification
    \item Continuous improvement feedback
\end{itemize}
